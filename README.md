# war_n_peas
Attempt to create a guess the flag java 
After completing one of Paul Hudsons projects in 100 days of SwiftUI i showed the app to my grand daughter and she was very impressed.
After adding more flags from various websites the app is now educational. My issue was that to give her the app on her ipad i would
have to pay the $100 developer fee then get it uploaded to the app store just for one download. so shoving it on html wth java and 
publishing on github would work well for me.

P.S.
the war and peas is a play on the words of the series "one Piece" which she was watching on Netflix.
